# Mission Statement (WIP)

> Build healthy communities starts with one: one home, one individual, one change.

A mission statement has been chosen. I wrote about the process [here](https://wesdottoday.hashnode.dev/choosing-a-mission-statement).

These are our working mission statements, roughly in order of current preference.

> We're on a mission to create a happier, healthier world - one home at a time.

> Building a healthier community - one person, one home, one remedy at a time.

> Creating a healthier world - one person, one home, one remedy at a time.

> Building a healthier world - one home, one remedity at a time.

> Health starts at home - we make that a reality.

> Health starts in the home - we’re on a mission to improve people’s health, one home at a time.

> Happiness and Health - we’re on a mission to create a happier, healthier world, one home at a time.

### Misc thoughts:

- Building, Creating, Establishing
- Remedy
- Healthier, Happier
- Home

Begin with empathy, follow up with love

Help improve people’s health by identifying toxic materials or air quality concerns in their homes and remediating the concerns. 

I want to take the knowledge and passion I’ve grown while fighting through infertility and other health issues to help people feel better. 

I want to bring a hands on and caring approach to our work. 

Technology can play a role in helping identify and protect people long term.

We will be thorough and detailed in our surveys. We will speak plainly about what we find and align the work we do directly to possible health outcomes.
