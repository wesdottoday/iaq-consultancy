# Excellence

We care deeply about people and their health and the communities they live in. That starts first with our own employees, their families, and our communities - then expands to our customers. 

We treat our employees with utmost respect, paying them above market rates, and offering benefits and training that are unmatched in the industry. In fact, our benefits often surpass the benefits offered in the tech industry. 

We are invested in our customer's health outcomes and truly want to make a difference in their lives. 

We treat our customers with empathy and great respect. We learn their concerns and desired outcomes and build custom programs to help get them to those outcomes. 

We speak in plain language, breaking down the technical concepts and their health effects, to ensure that customers understand the work we will be completing.

We own the outcomes of the work we complete and the work completed by our partners. We directly manage and inspect all work performed by partner companies, ensuring that our customers have a single point of contact for project success.
