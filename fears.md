# Fears

It's scary to think that I could be transitioning out of my tech career in 4-5 years. Tech is all I've known for the last ~15 years. Tech is safe. Tech pays extremely well.

I'm scared of failure.

I'm scared of not being as knowledgeable as I should be.

I'm scared of struggling to support my family through the transition.

Fear and anxiety can be healthy when targeted appropriately.
