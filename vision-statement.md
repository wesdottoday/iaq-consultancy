### Thoughts

- What is our organization’s main purpose?

To help people identify toxins in their home that contribute negatively to their health, then provide remediation options, and then provide support through the process of remediation.

- What are our company’s main strengths?

We care deeply about our customers. We take the time to learn their exact problems, collect data, research solutions, and provide a detailed plan on how to resolve the issues. We care about the health outcome for our customers, rather than just the numbers on a screen.

- What are our company values?

[Values](/values.md)

- Why does what we’re building matter?

Indoor Air Quality affects our health in a significant manner. Most people in the United States spend 90% of their time indoors, so this is more important than ever.

The capitalistic nature of our country ensures that products get to market quickly, but are not always tested to ensure the long term effects of the methods/means of production are safe for their customers.

Traditional home building methods rarely take into account air quality, toxins in the materials, bringing in fresh air, etc.

- How do we want to make a difference as a company?

We want to empower each and every person to live the healthiest life they can.

- What is our vision for our company culture?

We have a strong focus on empathy and love. We assume best intent from all employees and customers. We treat each other, our families, and our time with respect. Our families truly come first and we live that in our daily interactions and our employee benefits.

- What are our most ambitious goals?

To improve the health of individuals in 100 communities in 10 years. 

- What impact do we want our company to have on the world?

We want to impact material production, building architecture, design, and laws, as well as offer education for individuals around the world about the health effects of the products they use.

- What are our company wants? What about company needs?

We want to be the go to company when individuals can't figure out what is wrong with their health. We want to work with doctors, contractors, architects, city officials, etc to ensure that we are surrounding individuals with the care they deserve.
