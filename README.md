# Indoor Air Quality Consultancy

My goal is to transition from my tech career into running an Indoor Air Quality Consultancy as my full time job, slowly over the next five years.

I'm working with a coach, [Antoni Tzavelas](https://www.antonit.com/), to help plan this appropriately and focus my ideas into actionable goals. 

I'll be building this consultancy in public. Why is this important to me? A few reasons immediately come to mind: Accountability, Vulnerability, Community Idea input. So in that spirit you'll find draft ideas, proposals, company planning docs, dreams, and many other items in this repository as I start building. 

Building this company will have a slow burn, because it will require thoughtful planning for my family to make it a reality.

Begin with empathy, follow up with love

Help improve people’s health by identifying toxic materials or air quality concerns in their homes and remediating the concerns. 

I want to take the knowledge and passion I’ve grown while fighting through infertility and other health issues to help people feel better. 

I want to bring a hands on and caring approach to our work. 

Technology can play a role in helping identify and protect people long term.

We will be thorough and detailed in our surveys. We will speak plainly about what we find and align the work we do directly to possible health outcomes.
