# Indoor Air Quality Consultancy

My goal is to transition from my tech career into running an Indoor Air Quality Consultancy as my full time job, slowly over the next five years.

I'm working with a coach, [Antoni Tzavelas](https://www.antonit.com/), to help plan this appropriately and focus my ideas into actionable goals. 

I'll be building this consultancy in public. Why is this important to me? A few reasons immediately come to mind: Accountability, Vulnerability, Community Idea input. So in that spirit you'll find draft ideas, proposals, company planning docs, dreams, and many other items in this repository as I start building. So much of what you'll see in this repo will be incomplete thoughts, prompts for future thinking, etc. Be kind, rewind. (Yougin's may not get this joke)

Building this company will have a slow burn, because it will require thoughtful planning for my family to make it a reality.
